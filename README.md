# Moondream Examples

This repository contains sample code and examples to help developers learn how to work with [Moondream](https://moondream.ai), the world's most efficient multi-function Vision Language Model (VLM).

### About Moondream

Moondream is a state-of-the-art Vision Language Model that combines multiple vision capabilities in a tiny, efficient, and blazingly fast form factor. It's designed to be:

- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance and resource usage
- **Versatile**: Supports multiple vision-language tasks
- **Fast**: Delivers quick inference times
- **Compact**: Small model size without compromising capabilities

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

The examples in this project work with Python, Node, and Bash. Most examples are configured to run against Moondream locally using [Moondream Station](https://moondream.ai/station) â€“ a free Mac/Ubuntu app, or run against the [Moondream Cloud](https://moondream.ai/cloud), which offers a free tier.

#### How to use this project

Browse the examples contained, each one is fully functional, so you can run them as-is and tweak the code to suit your needs.

- **QuickStart**: A hello world example showing how to call the model
- **Detect Cars Tutorial**: Notebook demonstrating caption, query, detect, and point while processing car images
